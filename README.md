# Hungry-pets
Pet cards are generated every 30 seconds
You have to keep the pet alive by feeding it and showing it love
You must keep the hunger progress bar less than 100 by clicking the feed me button
Keep the love progress bar by clicking on the pet emoji
if any of the pets die, there will be no more generating pet cards. that will show that you are a bad pet-parent.
                           Enjoy the game.
